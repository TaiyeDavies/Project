	<div id="History">
		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>When Sony Computer Entertainment first announced the PlayStation 2 in 1999, the company had positioned the
			console as a centerpiece for home entertainment, as it not only would play video games, but also could play
			audio CDs and video DVDs.<br> Microsoft, whose business had been primarily in supporting the personal
			computer
			(PC)
			business with its Windows operating system, software, and games, saw the PlayStation 2 as a threat to the
			personal computer.<cite><a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox#cite_note-VentureBeat-5">[5]</a></cite><br>

			While the original Xbox had modest sales, Microsoft took a large financial loss to support it. However, its
			performance was sufficient to convince the company to continue to produce the line.<br> Since its release,
			there
			have been four generations of Xbox, with the most recent being the Xbox Series X and Series S units. The
			Xbox
			has become a direct competitor to Sony's PlayStation brand, both offering high performance gaming systems at
			roughly similar specifications.<br></p>
